  storyText: "\"Use one of the more useless scavenger ships as a decoy.\" Axel suggests.
    It takes quite a bit of convincing to find a ship that one of the scavengers is
    willing to part with. But the ship found isn't going to do him much good anyways,
    especially because he can't get off the planet.\r\n\r\nThe vessel is launched
    and can barely limp into high orbit, and notably it has been filled with volatile
    materials rigged to explode. As soon as it clears the protective invisible barrier
    that the satellite provides the drones begin to swarm it. At that same moment
    you and your new allies begin a break neck speed drive for the relay, with ships
    jumping one after another as soon as they can. With a very brief goodbye, your
    new friend jumps and you follow him quickly, jumping in the opposite direction
    into the system that is your goal."
