  m_Name: SP10. Scrap Distraction
  m_EditorClassIdentifier: 
  storyText: The bait that you create for the drones amounts to nothing more than
    a ball of scrap. As tightly packed together as the trash compactors can manage.
    Everything from recycled food containers to ship parts is packed in nice and tight,
    and then; using an overclocked escape pod thruster, launched toward the opposite
    end of the solar system.
