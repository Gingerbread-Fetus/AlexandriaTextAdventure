  storyText: "Despite the speed of your ship, the sheer number of drones proves to
    be too great for it to handle.\r\nBy the time that you reach the relay, your vessel
    is scarred with impact craters and the burns of the drones mining lasers. It feels
    as if you just barely made it through. You make a note in your ledger that the
    repairs will be expensive."
