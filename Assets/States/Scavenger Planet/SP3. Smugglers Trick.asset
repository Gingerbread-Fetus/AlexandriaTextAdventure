  storyText: "It's an old trick that you learned when you had to avoid automated patrols
    in the early days of your smuggling career. Rig some explosives somewhere else
    and the law won't you on the other side of town.\r\n\r\nThe drones don\u2019t
    quite respond as expected. They actually chase the missiles back and forth as
    they spiral to the moon, sometimes crashing into them. And when those that make
    it through crash into the moon the drones set to work picking up the pieces. Thus
    doubling the effectiveness of htis method. "
