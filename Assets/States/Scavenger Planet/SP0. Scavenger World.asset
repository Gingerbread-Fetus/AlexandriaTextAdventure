  storyText: "This barely populated planet is orbited by a large system of satellites
    that seem to be keeping the drones away. Like an electric fence they've chosen
    to ignore. \r\n\r\nThere is a healthy group of scavengers here taking refuge from
    the same swarm that just threatened you. While most of the planet is ancient ruins
    and wildlife these marooned survivors have created a sustainable life on the isolated
    planet. In their extended time on this planet they've built shelter, grown food,
    and even elected a leader.\r\n\r\nShortly after your landing, he approaches you
    and your crew. He's human, tall, with a beard that looks like he hasn't shaven
    in months. By choice, seeing as how none of the other inhabitants have beards.\r\n\r\n
    \u201CI'm surprised that you made it through okay. Pleasantly surprised.\u201D
    After some brief pleasantries and telling you that he and the others have been
    here for nearly a year, he does his best to explain the situation. \"That drone
    swarm is an ancient mining group designed to attach to any source of material
    that it can. It used to patrol these systems and gather any materials they needed
    while using the excess materials to maintain and support themselves. With their
    former drop off point uknown, we guess it's full, useless, or destroyed. So they've
    been mistaking passing ships as valid material and using them to grow their swarm
    exponentially.\" He stops to scratch at his beard. \"When the earliest of us discovered
    this place and were forced down here, I think there were only a few individuals,
    maybe a dozen.\" A moment later and he snaps back to attention. \"The source of
    the problem is the swarm communications sattelite was damaged. When damaged, it
    created a fault in their self-defense system. None of us can reach it to fix it.\""
