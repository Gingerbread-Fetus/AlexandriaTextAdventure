  storyText: "Although the instructions given by the satellite don\u2019t make sense
    to a normal organic\u2019s brain. To you the binary chattering of the machine
    is quite simple and easy to copy. You find that the signal the satellite is broadcasting
    is easily mimicked by any ship. And with a new intimate knowledge of the satellite
    you are able to pass this info along to everyone easily. Thus, clearing an easy
    path for your ramshackle fleet onwards. The relay is repaired quickly without
    having to worry about the drone swarm.\r\nAt the relay the scavenger elder thanks
    you for your time as his fleet begins to jump clear of the mining swarm at last."
