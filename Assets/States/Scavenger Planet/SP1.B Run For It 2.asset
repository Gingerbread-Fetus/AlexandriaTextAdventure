  storyText: "In the end, none of the scavengers volunteer to go with you. To them
    it seems better to wait for another ship rather than risk what would almost certainly
    be certain death in their inferior vessels.\r\n\r\nAs your ship passes from the
    outer orbit of the lonely planet, hundreds of individual signals appear on your
    ships sensors."
