  storyText: Lucky seems to go catatonic. Hardly moving for hours while he works with
    a weak connection to the satellite. He becomes so quiet at one point that when
    you enter the room to check on him you can hear the servos and joints of his body
    rotating and clicking. After a long period of work he comes back to reality. Noting
    that he found a way to work around the droids protocols and fix them and the relay.
