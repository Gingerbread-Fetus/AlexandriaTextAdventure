  storyText: "You have been hired for a very peculiar contract. It would seem that
    a collector would like for you to put together a team and travel into an old galactic
    government capital to recover an old computer. While most precursor computers
    have little data of use, depending on their state of decay, they have value to
    collectors.\r\n\r\nTheseus-01, or T-1 to the collection of wayward people who
    somehow call it home, takes its name from a constellation that was allegedly visible
    from the human homeworld. And it is the home to The White Bull, a dimly lit bar
    that is still dusty and dirty, no matter how many sterilization checks they do
    on visitors to the station. Dirty as any earthbound pub that you've ever been
    to at least. The White Bull is also the closest place where you might be able
    to pick up the crew members that you need. You approach the notification board,
    which flashes to life as you approach its proximity monitor.\r\n\r\nThe average
    crew for a ship of your size is going to need a pilot, and engineer, and a medic.\r\n"
