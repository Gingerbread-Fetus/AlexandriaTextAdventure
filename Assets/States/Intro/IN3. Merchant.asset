  storyText: Common merchants are both the key suppliers to settlements everywhere,
    and the key targets of pirates. To be a successful merchant means that you're
    either incredibly skilled or incredibly lucky, but preferably both. Your stock
    of goods makes you a valued partner for many, and your business knowledge gives
    you maps of popular trade routes between star systems.
