  storyText: "The first step of your journey will take you to Alexandria-One, a former
    capitol planet for the galactic empire . Most buildings there are now overrun
    with jungle, or overtaken by heavy flooding. Your directions are highly specific,
    down to exactly what building and what room you need to get into. However, the
    instructions are less specific about what the device you are to retrieve from
    these ruins actually does. In fact, they mention you should look for \"Object
    43-H\" and nothing else. The specific characteristics of this device are also
    described.\r\n\r\nThe first step to Alexandria is through the Scavengers territory.
    Typically benign salvagers who strip abandoned empire-era ships for materials
    stalk this zone. The wreckage of which is dangerously thick. They've formed a
    loose collective to ward off pirates, but are very welcome to visitors. Especially
    if they have any objects of interest for trade. They don't often communicate outside
    of their own territory, preferring to wait for merchants and travellers to come
    to the relative safety of their home."
