  storyText: It should go without saying that the job of an engineer is important
    to running any ship. There are many things that can go wrong on a starship, hundreds
    of thousands of possibilities that require improvisation to solve. Knowledgeable
    engineers can bypass any malfunction, and are keenly aware of the complex mechanics
    of starships.
