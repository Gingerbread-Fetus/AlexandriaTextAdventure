  storyText: Isani comes from a humanoid race of forest dwellers on the other end
    of the galaxy. With extremely lithe bodies and incredibly tough bones, their resilience
    often gives them the feeling of being invincible even long into their adulthood.
    As such, Dasos are characteristically known as impulsive risk takers. Culturally,
    the prestige of an individual is tied primarily to their skill, and not much else.
    Isani herself set out with a mercenary group that took her across the galaxy,
    from rim to rim she claims, a claim backed up by the astonishing number of pilots
    for hire who know her name. However, incident after incident of her disobeying
    orders blots her record, and perhaps explains her retirement from her previous
    company.
