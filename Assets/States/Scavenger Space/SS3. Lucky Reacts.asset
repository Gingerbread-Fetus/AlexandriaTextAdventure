  storyText: "\u201CHold Positions!\u201D Lucky whirs from the silent state that he
    usually operates in while in the cockpit. \u201COrganics, I must inform you that
    the ship before us is part of a much larger and more violent swarm. Please hold
    while I try to convince it to leave.\u201D After a few seconds of near silence,
    nothing more than the servos in his neck clicking as he occasionally looks at
    the controls in front of him. After a minute of work, the drone seems to come
    to life and leave.\r\n\r\nPretty soon the swarm that the lone drone belongs to
    appears. \"Although I have convinced the swarm that we are not an object of interest.
    I suggest we proceed towards the heading of this star's third planetoid. The drones
    seem to be acting in a defensive mode and any hasty action could lead to us being
    interpreted as a threat. But Captain, they seem to be actively avoiding that region
    of space.\""
