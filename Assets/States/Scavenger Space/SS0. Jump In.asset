  storyText: As your ship jumps into the system that marks the edge of Scavenger space,
    there's something strange continuously beeping on your ship sensors. The object
    seems to be a derelict ship, presumably belonging to a Scavenger crew, now lifelessly
    drifing in orbit around a planetoid in this system's astroid belt. Given its size
    it would appear to be nothing more than a small mining vessel, likely mass-produced
    centuries ago. What do you do?
