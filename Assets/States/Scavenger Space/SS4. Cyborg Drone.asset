  storyText: Like a dull thrum in both of your ears, you feel as if you are somewhere
    else while your crew is busy observing the derelict drone. Something like a low
    whisper across the void of space begins to invade your ears. There isn't just
    one voice, but a collection, a swarm. They don't speak in words but in primitive
    thoughts, but you understand them perfectly. "Collect. Grow. Gather. Collect.
    Grow. Gather." With a slow rhythm they seem to repeat in unison. There are other
    thoughts there too, wordless ones that seem to interpret your intentions better
    than you could ever explain. Before you know it, the drone stirs to life and drifts
    off towards the edge of the system.
