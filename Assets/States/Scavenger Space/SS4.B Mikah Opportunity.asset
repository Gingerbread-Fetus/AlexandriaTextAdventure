  storyText: Mikah has noticed a wrecked ship that wasn't showing on the sensors before.
    And notes that there is an opportunity to search it for goods. On board that vessel
    are potentially valuable mechanical parts, and the bodies of the former crew.
    Believing that the parts may be valuable later you place them in cargo and continue
    onward.
