  storyText: Perhaps it is better not to allow a malfunctioning autonomous machine
    to drift around in occupied space. You order $engineer to open fire on the drone.
    But as you do, the deactivated machine spins to life and begins to fire back.
    And as it does, you detect similar signals appearing on the edge of the system.
