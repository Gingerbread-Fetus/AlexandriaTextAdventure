  storyText: "\u201CBastards!\u201D he shouts, as a small and covertly prepared volley
    from the small forward guns is released. The shots seem to stall the already damaged
    ship, which still does not respond to hails. From the edge of the star system
    is a growing blob of similar small ships, all coming from near light speeds. Mikah
    has already turned the ship around, giving you a significant advantage over the
    swarm quickly encroaching on you. Mikah's opportunism gives you such a lead on
    the swarm that you're able to avoid them."
