  storyText: 'Despite the weak weapons on these mining drones, their sheer number
    makes them more than a credible threat. The shields on your ship can absorb much
    of the incoming energy. The difficult, and more dangerous problem, is the drones
    simply ramming the ship or trying to attach to it. Thus far, none of them have
    been able to penetrate the hull. '
