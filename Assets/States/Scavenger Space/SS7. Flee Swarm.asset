  storyText: 'As your ship maneuvers to avoid the drone it seems to react, coming
    to life quickly and beginning pursuit. Weak volleys from its mining lasers glance
    off the shields of your ship. Far too weak to get through or cause any real damage.
    However, as you''re moving your way towards the edge of this system, towards escaping
    to safe jump distance more and more ships begin to appear on your sensors. A swarm
    of mining drones is now diligently following you and your crew. Even as you prepare
    to jump to then next system your sensors are tracking hundreds of engines that
    are ready to do the same. '
