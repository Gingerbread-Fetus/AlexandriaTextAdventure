  storyText: You remember having read once that these old drones usually had exclusion
    zones, areas where they were forbidden to operate. A quick scan of the system
    is able to quickly find one such zone within easy reach. As you reach safety,
    the drones can be seen on your sensors and in many of the viewports on the ship,
    circling like a hungry swarm.
