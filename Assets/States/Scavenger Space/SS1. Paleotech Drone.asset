  storyText: "You recognize the vessel as an old mining drone, to your appraising
    eyes, it has all the necessary markings, the shape, and of course the equipment.
    This kind of vessel is by no means rare. However, this one seems to be behaving
    strangely, like it's looking for something particular. These types of drones are
    known to malfunction when they have been left off for too long. Dangerously so.
    You decide that it would be safer to approach the ship if it were disabled, and
    you order $engineer to open fire.\r\n\r\nNo sooner than the first hit glances
    off the polarized plating of the drone, it spins to life and flees. Leaving behind
    nothing more than a strange subspace distress signal."
