  storyText: "You land on Alexandria to discover that the jungle has overgrown all
    of what used to be one solid mass of cityscape. Buildings sink into lakes, Trees
    grow in and out of skyscrapers, grow bigger than them. You follow the local coordinates
    that were given to you in the contract. To your surprise. The coordinates seem
    to be for a library.\r\nMany of the systems inside are either dead or barely hanging
    on. But to your surprise, much of the datashelves are still accessible and contain
    potentially valuable info available for download. As you and your team move deeper
    into the library, there are even physical copies of books as well. Something that
    could go to a collector for a fortune if the titles are right.\r\nAs the instructions
    detailed, you move into the basement levels. The security has long been deactivated,
    but as you get closer to your goal you can hear a robotic voice chattering aloud.\r\n\u201CThe
    earliest homeworlds of the galactic government were actually run by reptilians.\u201D
    It says as you enter the room. \u201CHumans seem to have evolved most directly
    from primates.\u201D There\u2019s a small talking personality core on a stand
    in the room. You realize that as you approach it, it is talking\r\nabout human
    history. \u201CI am Object 43-H. My reconstruction algorithms are 97.53% correct.
    What would you like to know about galactic history?\u201D"
