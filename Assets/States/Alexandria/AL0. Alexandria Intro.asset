  storyText: "Finally, Alexandria is before you. It\u2019s no surprise that the planet
    was once a capital for the old Empire. The planet is absolutely Massive, especially
    for a terrestrial planet. From orbit the planet appears to be a giant green ball.
    With blue-green lakes decorating the service that must be as large as seas on
    other planets.\r\nAlexandria was less verdant in the past. But when the government
    fell apart, the inhabitants didn\u2019t see much of a point in keeping up the
    diligent attention it took to keep the rapidly growing jungle at bay. Eventually
    the inhabitants disappeared into the massive foliage. Rumors tell of isolated
    groups of enlightened tribes that protect the ruins on the planet like they are
    holy temples."
