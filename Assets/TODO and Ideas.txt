-A better background, find a better color scheme first. Then see about adding assets to the background. Maybe an animated space station on a starry backdrop.
-Events? Special Effects?
-Adding buttons to the scrollable window instead of text.
-Add variables for conditional choices. If(cyborg){Do this}. This may require a method to add/remove states from the nextstates list.
	-One way to do this may be instead to exclude certain options from showing if their conditions are NOT true. EG: if(!(Captain.Equals("Isani")){Don't print.} This would be easily achievable by adding a condition requirement to the State class, maybe just passing in a string.
