-A better background, find a better color scheme first. Then see about adding assets to the background. Maybe an animated space station on a starry backdrop.
- Adding effects to the text, like temporary shaking.
-Sound effects
-Music
-Adding buttons to the scrollable window instead of text.(This is a maybe, but if I can make text in a TMP object clickable I may as well)
-Add functionality for inserting character names into text. (Probably best achieved by adding a method to parse the text for delimiters)
-Add quit functionality with the q key.
-Add a skip key, I'm thinking I'll bind it to 's'
